Pesapal API 3.0
Welcome to Pesapal API 3.0. Getting started with Pesapal is quick and easy!

In this release, you will learn how to use our API endpoints to access Pesapal services. Our APIs are built on REST(Representational State Transfer) thus our data entities are represented as HTTP resources and are accessed using HTTP verbs GET and POST. Requests and responses are JSON encoded.

Find information about integrating your website with Pesapal. This documentation includes sample codes for each API we have.

Authentication Endpoint - Post Request
Pesapal's API Authentication requests are done via a POST request.

Your Pesapal merchant consumer_key and consumer_secret will be used to generate an access token.

The URL to our token generation API is either:

IPN URL Registration Endpoint - Post Request
IPN stands for Instant Payment Notification. When a payment is made against a transaction, Pesapal will trigger an IPN call to the notification URL related to this transaction. This notification URL is usually located on your servers. These notifications allows you to be alerted in real time whenever there is a status change for any transaction.

An IPN is particular important as it allows you to be notified incase the following happens:

Your client gets disconnected after payment due to internet issues
Your client experiences server errors hence Pesapal and your application gets disconnected before callback URL is loaded.
Your client exits your application / closes the browser during payment.
The transaction is rejected.
As such, it's mandatory to have IPN configured to allow Pesapal to notify your servers when a status changes. It's also important to note that this IPN URL must be publicly available. In cases where you have strict server rules preventing external systems reaching your end, you must then whitelist all calls from our domain (pesapal.com). Please be informed that IP whitelisting is not feasible as our IP may change without notice.

Before sending Submit Order Requests to Pesapal API 3.0, you are expected to register your IPN URL. Upon registration, you receive an IPN ID which is a mandatory field (notification_id) when submitting an order request to Pesapal API 3.0. This notification_id uniquely identifies the endpoint Pesapal will send alerts to whenever a payment status changes for each transaction processed via API 3.0

The URL to our IPN registration API is either:

Submit Order Request Endpoint - Post Request
Once you have received the bearer token, the next step will be the actual request to create a payment request.

A good example would be a case where the customer has clicked pay now button on your website. At this point, you call the SubmitOrderRequest and in return you will get a response which contains a payment redirect URL which you then redirect the customer to or load the URL as an iframe within your site in case you donâ€™t want to redirect the customer off your application.

The payment URL will contain the payment methods presented to the customer by Pesapal. After the customer has made the payment, they will be redirected to your callback URL which you will have already provided to us as part of submit order request.

    "order_tracking_id": "b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04",
3
    "merchant_reference": "TEST1515111119",
4
    "redirect_url": "https://cybqa.pesapal.com/pesapaliframe/PesapalIframe3/Index/?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04",

    "error": null,

}
Redirecting your customer to this redirect_url will present them with a list of available payment methods which they can use to make the payment.

You can either load this URL outside or within your website (using an Iframe). The advantage of using an iframe is that your customer will not be redirected off the site, hence a seamless payment process.

Once your customer selects their preferred payment method and makes a payment, Pesapal will process the payment and redirect your customers to the callback URL which you had provided as part of the SubmitOrderRequest API call.

Callback Details
The following parameter will be appended to your callback URL.

Parameter	Type	Description
OrderTrackingId	String	Unique order id generated by Pesapal.
OrderNotificationType	String	Has value CALLBACKURL to represent a callback request
OrderMerchantReference	String	Your application's unique ID received as part of the SUBMIT ORDER REQUEST.

Sample Callback URL: https://www.myapplication.com/response-page?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04&OrderMerchantReference=TEST1515111119&OrderNotificationType=CALLBACKURL

IPN Details
At the same time, Pesapal will send an alert to your IPN URL informing you of a status change.

The IPN alert will either be a GET or POST request, depending on which HTTP method you selected when registering the IPN URL.

The IPN call will have the following parameters;

Parameter	Type	Description
OrderTrackingId	String	Unique order id generated by Pesapal.
OrderNotificationType	String	Has value IPNCHANGE to represent an IPN call.
OrderMerchantReference	String	Your application's unique ID received as part of the SUBMIT ORDER REQUEST.
Sample GET URL
https://www.myapplication.com/response-page?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04&OrderMerchantReference=TEST1515111119&OrderNotificationType=IPNCHANGE

Sample POST data
1
{
2
    "OrderNotificationType":"IPNCHANGE",
3
    "OrderTrackingId":"b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04",
4
    "OrderMerchantReference":"TEST1515111119"
5
}
The callback URL and the IPN calls will NOT have the status of the payment for security reasons. As such, you will be required to fetch the status of the payment using the GetTransactionStatus API once the callback page is loaded and when the IPN URL is triggered.

Get Transaction Status Endpoint - Get Request
Once Pesapal redirect your customer to your callback URL and triggers your IPN URL, you need to check the status of the payment using the OrderTrackingId.

The URL to our GetTransactionStatus API is either:

Sandbox/Demo URL: https://cybqa.pesapal.com/pesapalv3/api/Transactions/GetTransactionStatus?orderTrackingId=xxxxxxxxxxxx
Production/Live URL: https://pay.pesapal.com/v3/api/Transactions/GetTransactionStatus?orderTrackingId=xxxxxxxxxxxx
Where xxxxxxxxxxxx represents the OrderTrackingId received as part of the callback [GET] or IPN [POST/GET] params.

What Next?
Once you've received the payment details, you are then required to store the same in your system and provide services / services paid for.

Your IPN endpoint should then respond to Pesapal with a json string confirming receipt of the IPN call. Part of the json string contains a status parameter that should be set as 200 (meaning request was received and processed) or 500 (meaning IPN request was received but there was an issue completing the process).

Sample IPN JSON Response String: {"orderNotificationType":"IPNCHANGE","orderTrackingId":"d0fa69d6-f3cd-433b-858e-df86555b86c8","orderMerchantReference":"1515111111","status":200}

NB: Your callback page should not implement a json response. Instead, redirect the customer to a page on your system showing the payment details.
