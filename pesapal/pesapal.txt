Pesapal API 3.0
Welcome to Pesapal API 3.0. Getting started with Pesapal is quick and easy!

In this release, you will learn how to use our API endpoints to access Pesapal services. Our APIs are built on REST(Representational State Transfer) thus our data entities are represented as HTTP resources and are accessed using HTTP verbs GET and POST. Requests and responses are JSON encoded.

Find information about integrating your website with Pesapal. This documentation includes sample codes for each API we have.

IPN URL Registration Endpoint - Post Request
IPN stands for Instant Payment Notification. When a payment is made against a transaction, Pesapal will trigger an IPN call to the notification URL related to this transaction. This notification URL is usually located on your servers. These notifications allows you to be alerted in real time whenever there is a status change for any transaction.

An IPN is particular important as it allows you to be notified incase the following happens:

Your client gets disconnected after payment due to internet issues
Your client experiences server errors hence Pesapal and your application gets disconnected before callback URL is loaded.
Your client exits your application / closes the browser during payment.
The transaction is rejected.
As such, it's mandatory to have IPN configured to allow Pesapal to notify your servers when a status changes. It's also important to note that this IPN URL must be publicly available. In cases where you have strict server rules preventing external systems reaching your end, you must then whitelist all calls from our domain (pesapal.com). Please be informed that IP whitelisting is not feasible as our IP may change without notice.

Before sending Submit Order Requests to Pesapal API 3.0, you are expected to register your IPN URL. Upon registration, you receive an IPN ID which is a mandatory field (notification_id) when submitting an order request to Pesapal API 3.0. This notification_id uniquely identifies the endpoint Pesapal will send alerts to whenever a payment status changes for each transaction processed via API 3.0

The URL to our IPN registration API is either:

3
    "merchant_reference": "TEST1515111119",
4
    "redirect_url": "https://cybqa.pesapal.com/pesapaliframe/PesapalIframe3/Index/?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04",

    "status": "200"
7
}
Redirecting your customer to this redirect_url will present them with a list of available payment methods which they can use to make the payment.

You can either load this URL outside or within your website (using an Iframe). The advantage of using an iframe is that your customer will not be redirected off the site, hence a seamless payment process.

Once your customer selects their preferred payment method and makes a payment, Pesapal will process the payment and redirect your customers to the callback URL which you had provided as part of the SubmitOrderRequest API call.

Callback Details
The following parameter will be appended to your callback URL.

Parameter	Type	Description
OrderTrackingId	String	Unique order id generated by Pesapal.
OrderNotificationType	String	Has value CALLBACKURL to represent a callback request
OrderMerchantReference	String	Your application's unique ID received as part of the SUBMIT ORDER REQUEST.

Sample Callback URL: https://www.myapplication.com/response-page?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04&OrderMerchantReference=TEST1515111119&OrderNotificationType=CALLBACKURL

IPN Details
At the same time, Pesapal will send an alert to your IPN URL informing you of a status change.

The IPN alert will either be a GET or POST request, depending on which HTTP method you selected when registering the IPN URL.

The IPN call will have the following parameters;

Parameter	Type	Description
OrderTrackingId	String	Unique order id generated by Pesapal.
OrderNotificationType	String	Has value IPNCHANGE to represent an IPN call.
OrderMerchantReference	String	Your application's unique ID received as part of the SUBMIT ORDER REQUEST.
Sample GET URL
https://www.myapplication.com/response-page?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04&OrderMerchantReference=TEST1515111119&OrderNotificationType=IPNCHANGE

Sample POST data
1
{
2
    "OrderNotificationType":"IPNCHANGE",
3
    "OrderTrackingId":"b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04",
4
    "OrderMerchantReference":"TEST1515111119"
5
}
The callback URL and the IPN calls will NOT have the status of the payment for security reasons. As such, you will be required to fetch the status of the payment using the GetTransactionStatus API once the callback page is loaded and when the IPN URL is triggered.

Get Transaction Status Endpoint - Get Request
Once Pesapal redirect your customer to your callback URL and triggers your IPN URL, you need to check the status of the payment using the OrderTrackingId.

The URL to our GetTransactionStatus API is either:

Sandbox/Demo URL: https://cybqa.pesapal.com/pesapalv3/api/Transactions/GetTransactionStatus?orderTrackingId=xxxxxxxxxxxx
Production/Live URL: https://pay.pesapal.com/v3/api/Transactions/GetTransactionStatus?orderTrackingId=xxxxxxxxxxxx
Where xxxxxxxxxxxx represents the OrderTrackingId received as part of the callback [GET] or IPN [POST/GET] params.

What Next?
Once you've received the payment details, you are then required to store the same in your system and provide services / services paid for.

Your IPN endpoint should then respond to Pesapal with a json string confirming receipt of the IPN call. Part of the json string contains a status parameter that should be set as 200 (meaning request was received and processed) or 500 (meaning IPN request was received but there was an issue completing the process).

Sample IPN JSON Response String: {"orderNotificationType":"IPNCHANGE","orderTrackingId":"d0fa69d6-f3cd-433b-858e-df86555b86c8","orderMerchantReference":"1515111111","status":200}

NB: Your callback page should not implement a json response. Instead, redirect the customer to a page on your system showing the payment details.


Recurring / Subscription Based Payments
Definitions
Recurring payment is a payment model where customers authorize the business to pull funds from their accounts automatically at regular intervals for the goods and services provided to them on an ongoing basis.

With Pesapal's subscription based payments, customers can set automated card payments on their account where they can be debited automatically at a different set times. Examples of services one can enroll to include cable bills, cell phone bills, gym membership fees, utility bills and magazine subscriptions. These payments can be set to run an various intervals such as daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.

How can recurring payments benefit your business?
Saves customers time: Customers no longer have to go through the payment process every time they need to make a payment.
Ensures prompt payment: Businesses no longer need to worry about getting paid on time. Since the payments are automated, they no longer need to send out overdue payment reminders.
Boosts customer loyalty: With a subscription model, businesses can form closer relationships with their customers.
Cash flow prediction: Businesses can easily predict their cash flow, which helps with business strategy.
Lowers billing and collection costs: Businesses no longer need to chase after missed payments, freeing up their time to concentrate on other elements of the business.
How do i enable recurring payment for my customers?
Enable our subscription based payments by passing an additional account_number field when sending data to our SubmitOrderRequest endpoint. This account_number should relate to an account number / invoice number that helps you identify the payment.

Note: It's critical that you get to understand all other Pesapal API 3.0 endpoints before implementing the recurring feature. Click here to get started.

In adition to the SubmitOrderRequest parameters, include one more param as show below.

Parameter	Required	Description
account_number	Optional	Customer's identification number know to your system. This can be an invoice number or an account number.

    "account_number": "555-678"
23
}   
After successfully processing your request using the SubmitOrderRequest endpoint, the customer will be shown an option to opt into the recurring model on the Pesapal iframe during payment. The customer will then configure the frequency (Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly), set a start and enddate, and finally enter an amount to be automatically deducted from their card on each payment cycle.

Pesapal Recurring Form
Once the customer has made a successful payment, Pesapal will automatically create a scheduled subscription on their behalf and an email alert will be sent to the provided card billing email that was used during the payment proccess, notifying them of the newly created subscription together with a link they can access a dashboard to manage their subscription.

Pesapal will NOT store the customer's card details. Instead, Pesapal has implemented the card tokenization technology.

Credit card tokenization is the process of de-identifying sensitive cardholder data by converting it to a string of randomly generated numbers called a "token." Similar to encryption, tokenization obfuscates the original data to render it unreadable to a user. Unlike encryption, however, credit card tokenization is irreversible.

Is it possible to send the extra subscription parameters (Frequency, amount, period) via the API?
Yes, in cases where your application already handles the process where the customer opts into a subscription based model from your application, Pesapal allows your to send these extra parameters via the API. This ensures that the user does not have to fill in the same details again (on your application and on the Pesapal Iframe).

However, it's important to note that the customer MUST accept to enroll to your subscription on the iframe. They will however not be able to edit the subscription details on the iframe.


In adition to the account_number parameter included in the SubmitOrderRequest, you are required to send the following parameter.

Parameter	Required	Description
subscription_details	Optional	Customer Subscription Object You can pass subscription data to Pesapal allowing a user to setup recurring payment..
Subscription Object

Name	Type	Required	Description
start_date	String	Mandatory	Your subscription's start date in the format dd-MM-yyyy e.g 24-01-2023 representing 24th Jan 2023

After successfully processing your request using the SubmitOrderRequest endpoint, the customer will be shown an option to opt into the recurring model on the Pesapal iframe during payment. The iframe will this time load without he options to re-select the Frequecy, period and dates.

Pesapal Recurring Form

Can a customer opt out of recurring payments before the end date?
Yes, customers have the right to cancel their subscription at anytime. Pesapal will send them email alerts a day or two prior to charging their cards. This ensures customers are always aware of all upcoming charges giving them the freedom to opt out or pausing their subscriptions.

Which cards are currently supported?
We currently support Visa and MasterCard for recurring payments. More card options will be enabled in the near future.

How will Pesapal alert my business about successful recurring payments?
Once a schedule is created and executed successfully, Pesapal will trigger an IPN (Instant Payment Notification) to the IPN endpoint you provided when calling the SubmitOrderRequest endpoint. This IPN call will have the OrderNotificationTypei> set as RECURRING.

Sample IPN URL: https://www.myapplication.com/response-page?OrderTrackingId=b945e4af-80a5-4ec1-8706-e03f8332fb04&OrderMerchantReference=555-678&OrderNotificationType=RECURRING

Recurring IPN Details
The IPN alert will either be a GET or POST request, depending on which HTTP method you selected when registering the IPN URL. Click here for more details on how to register your IPN endpoint.

The IPN call will have the following parameters;

Parameter	Type	Description
OrderTrackingId	String	Unique order id generated by Pesapal.
OrderNotificationType	String	Value set as RECURRING to represent a Recurring IPN call.
OrderMerchantReference	String	Your account number received as part of the SUBMIT ORDER REQUEST.

The IPN call will NOT have all details of the payment for security reasons. As such, you will be required to fetch the payment using the GetTransactionStatus API once the IPN URL is triggered.
In addition to the normal payment status details received from the GetTransactionStatus endpoint, Pesapal will append an object subscription_transaction_info containing some additional recurring payment data

Recurring Payments Extra Data (subscription_transaction_info)

Name	Description
account_reference	Customer's identification number know to your system. This can be an invoice number or an account number.
amount	Amount paid by the customer.
first_name	Customer's first name.
last_name	Customer's last name.
correlation_id	Pesapal's unique recurring payment identifier / id.

What Next?
Once you've fetched the recurring data, you are then required to store the same in your system and provide services / goods as subscribed.

Your IPN endpoint should then respond to Pesapal with a json string confirming service delivery. Part of the json string contains a status parameter that should be set as 200 (meaning request was received and processed) or 500 (meaning request was received but there was an issue providing the services).

Sample JSON Response String: {"orderNotificationType":"RECURRING","orderTrackingId":"d0fa69d6-f3cd-433b-858e-df86555b86c8","orderMerchantReference":"555-678","status":200}

NB: Constant complains from your customers about service / goods not delivered which were paid using recurring / subscription based payment mode will lead to the subscriptions being terminated and your profile banned from using the feature.
