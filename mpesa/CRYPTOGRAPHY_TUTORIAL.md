## What is Cryptography?

**Cryptography** is the science of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format. Think of it as a secret code that only authorized people can understand.

### 🏰 Medieval Analogy
Imagine you're a knight sending a secret message to another castle. You write your message, then scramble the letters using a special pattern. Only the knight who knows the pattern can unscramble and read your message.

### Modern Use Cases
- 💳 **Banking**: Protecting your credit card information online
- 📱 **Messaging**: WhatsApp encrypts your messages
- 🌐 **Websites**: HTTPS protects data between your browser and websites
- 🏪 **Payment Systems**: M-Pesa uses encryption to secure transactions

## Basic Concepts

### 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Plaintext** | Original, readable message | "Hello World" |
| **Ciphertext** | Encrypted, unreadable message | "Uryyb Jbeyq" |
| **Encryption** | Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext | Making a secret code |
| **Decryption** | Process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext | Solving the secret code |
| **Key** | Secret information used for encryption/decryption | Password or code pattern |

### 🔄 The Encryption Process

```
Plaintext → [Encryption + Key] → Ciphertext
Ciphertext → [Decryption + Key] → Plaintext
```

---

## Types of Encryption

There are two main types of encryption:

### 1. 🔐 Symmetric Encryption (One Key)
- Uses the **same key** for both encryption and decryption
- Like having one key for both locking and unlocking a door

### 2. 🔑🔓 Asymmetric Encryption (Two Keys)
- Uses **two different keys**: a public key and a private key
- Like having a mailbox: anyone can put mail in (public), but only you have the key to open it (private)

---

## Symmetric Encryption

### How It Works
Both sender and receiver share the same secret key.

```
Alice has Key: "SECRET123"
Bob has Key: "SECRET123"

Alice: "Hello" + "SECRET123" → "X9Z2K" → sends to Bob
Bob: "X9Z2K" + "SECRET123" → "Hello"
```

### 📋 Example: Caesar Cipher
One of the oldest encryption methods - shift each letter by a fixed number.

```python
def caesar_encrypt(message, shift):
    encrypted = ""
    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97
            encrypted += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)
        else:
            encrypted += char
    return encrypted

# Example
message = "HELLO"
shift = 3
encrypted = caesar_encrypt(message, shift)
print(f"Original: {message}")
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")  # Output: KHOOR
```

### ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

**Pros:**
- Fast and efficient
- Good for large amounts of data

**Cons:**
- Key distribution problem (how do you safely share the key?)
- If the key is compromised, everything is compromised

---

## Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key)

### How It Works
Each person has a **pair of keys**:
- 🌍 **Public Key**: Shared with everyone (like your email address)
- 🔒 **Private Key**: Kept secret (like your password)

### 📬 The Mailbox Analogy

Think of it like a special mailbox:
1. **Public Key** = The mail slot (anyone can drop mail in)
2. **Private Key** = The mailbox key (only you can open and read mail)

### 🔄 How It Works

```
Alice wants to send Bob a secret message:

1. Alice gets Bob's PUBLIC key (available to everyone)
2. Alice encrypts message with Bob's PUBLIC key
3. Alice sends encrypted message to Bob
4. Bob uses his PRIVATE key to decrypt the message
5. Only Bob can read it!
```

### 📊 Visual Example

```
Bob's Key Pair:
Public Key: 🔓 (everyone can see this)
Private Key: 🔑 (only Bob has this)

Alice → Encrypts "Hello" with 🔓 → "X9Z2K" → Bob
Bob → Decrypts "X9Z2K" with 🔑 → "Hello"
```

### ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

**Pros:**
- Solves key distribution problem
- Very secure
- Enables digital signatures

**Cons:**
- Slower than symmetric encryption
- More complex

## Digital Signatures

Digital signatures prove that a message came from a specific person and hasn't been tampered with.

### 🖋️ How It Works

```
1. Alice writes a message
2. Alice "signs" it with her PRIVATE key
3. Anyone can verify the signature using Alice's PUBLIC key
4. This proves:
   - The message came from Alice (authentication)
   - The message hasn't been changed (integrity)
```

### 📝 Real-World Example
When you download software, the company signs it with their private key. Your computer checks the signature with their public key to ensure it's genuine and hasn't been modified by hackers.

---

## Hashing

Hashing creates a unique "fingerprint" of data.

### 🔍 What is a Hash?
- Takes any input and produces a fixed-size output
- Always produces the same hash for the same input
- Even tiny changes in input create completely different hashes

### 📋 Example

```python
import hashlib

message1 = "Hello World"
message2 = "Hello world"  # Notice lowercase 'w'

hash1 = hashlib.sha256(message1.encode()).hexdigest()
hash2 = hashlib.sha256(message2.encode()).hexdigest()

print(f"Message 1: {message1}")
print(f"Hash 1: {hash1}")
print(f"Message 2: {message2}")
print(f"Hash 2: {hash2}")
print(f"Same hash? {hash1 == hash2}")
```

### 💡 Common Uses
- **Password Storage**: Websites store hash of your password, not the actual password
- **File Integrity**: Check if files have been corrupted or modified
- **Blockchain**: Bitcoin uses hashing for proof-of-work

---

## Real-World Examples

### 1. 📱 WhatsApp Messages
```
Your message → Encrypted with recipient's public key → Sent through internet → 
Decrypted with recipient's private key → Message appears on their phone
```

### 2. 🌐 HTTPS Websites
```
Your data → Encrypted with website's public key → Sent to website → 
Website decrypts with private key → Processes your request
```

### 3. 💳 Credit Card Payments
```
Card details → Encrypted → Sent to bank → Bank decrypts → Processes payment
```

## M-Pesa API Encryption Example

Let's look at how the M-Pesa API uses encryption (based on the code in this folder):

### 🔄 The Process

1. **Get Session ID**: M-Pesa gives you a session ID
2. **Get Public Key**: M-Pesa provides their public key
3. **Encrypt Session ID**: You encrypt the session ID with their public key
4. **Send Encrypted ID**: You send the encrypted session ID back to M-Pesa
5. **M-Pesa Decrypts**: M-Pesa uses their private key to decrypt and verify

### 📋 Code Example (Simplified)

```python
# What happens in mpesa-sess-id.py:

def encrypt_session_id(public_key, session_id):
    # 1. Load M-Pesa's public key
    public_key = load_public_key(public_key)
    
    # 2. Encrypt session ID with their public key
    encrypted = public_key.encrypt(session_id)
    
    # 3. Convert to Base64 for transmission
    return base64.encode(encrypted)

# Usage
session_id = "e2f8992444594c85bed03d144c4318a0"  # From M-Pesa
mpesa_public_key = "MIICIjANBg..."              # From M-Pesa
encrypted_id = encrypt_session_id(mpesa_public_key, session_id)

# Send encrypted_id back to M-Pesa in your API calls
```

### 🛡️ Why This Works

1. **Security**: Only M-Pesa can decrypt the session ID (they have the private key)
2. **Authentication**: Proves you received the session ID from M-Pesa
3. **Integrity**: Ensures the session ID hasn't been tampered with

## Best Practices

### 🔒 For Developers

1. **Never store private keys in code**
   ```python
   # ❌ Bad
   private_key = "MIIEvwIBADANBg..."
   
   # ✅ Good
   private_key = os.getenv('PRIVATE_KEY')
   ```

2. **Use established libraries**
   ```python
   # ✅ Use proven libraries like cryptography
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
   ```

3. **Always use random keys**
   ```python
   # ✅ Generate random keys
   key = os.urandom(32)  # 256-bit key
   ```

4. **Validate inputs**
   ```python
   # ✅ Always validate before encryption
   if not session_id or len(session_id) < 10:
       raise ValueError("Invalid session ID")
   ```

### 🛡️ For Users

1. **Use strong passwords** (or better yet, password managers)
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** where available
3. **Keep software updated** (security patches)
4. **Be cautious with public Wi-Fi** for sensitive activities

   <details>
   <summary>Click for answer</summary>
   
   Hashing is a one-way function. It's designed to be irreversible for security purposes.
   </details>

3. **In the M-Pesa example, who has the private key?**
